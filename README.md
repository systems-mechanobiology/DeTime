DeTime provides one stable software surface for decomposition workflows that
would otherwise be split across notebooks, method-specific wrappers, and
one-off scripts. The product name is **DeTime**, the distribution is
`de-time`, the canonical import is `detime`, and the legacy top-level
`tsdecomp` import and CLI remain compatibility-only through `0.1.x`, with
earliest removal planned for `0.2.0`.

The current release is `0.1.1`. Install the published package from PyPI with
`python -m pip install de-time`, or use the editable contributor path below for
local development.

## Scope

Use DeTime when you want:

- one `decompose()` entrypoint,
- one `DecompositionConfig` model for Python and CLI usage,
- one `DecompResult` contract for `trend`, `season`, `residual`, `components`,
  and `meta`,
- native acceleration where it materially improves throughput,
- multivariate decomposition workflows where shared structure matters,
- machine-facing workflows that need schemas, recommendations, and low-token
  result views.

Use a specialist package directly when you only need that package's deepest
family-specific API.

## Core and accelerated methods

The main package is centered on four core maintained methods:

- `SSA`
- `STD`
- `STDR`
- `MSSA`

The current native-backed accelerated set is broader:

- core native paths: `SSA`, `STD`, `STDR`, `MSSA`
- additional native-backed methods: `VMD`, `GABOR_CLUSTER`
- lightweight native-backed baseline: `MA_BASELINE`

Other retained methods are wrappers, Python implementations, or
optional-backend integrations such as `STL`, `MSTL`, `ROBUST_STL`, `EMD`,
`CEEMDAN`, `WAVELET`, `MVMD`, and `MEMD`.

Experimental neural decomposition blocks extracted as standalone DeTime
methods are also available. They are package-level experimental operators for
decomposition-head ablations, reusable result-contract tests, and interface
coverage.

| Block | Source architecture family | Standalone operator exposed in DeTime | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| `AMD_BLOCK` | adaptive multiscale decomposition | multiscale smoothing trend with periodic-template seasonality | non-learned extractor |
| `AUTOFORMER_BLOCK` | Autoformer | moving-average trend and residual-seasonal split | non-learned extractor |
| `DELELSTM_BLOCK` | DeLELSTM | Holt-style trend with periodic-template seasonality | non-learned extractor |
| `DLINEAR_BLOCK` | DLinear | moving-average decomposition head | non-learned extractor |
| `FREQMOE_BLOCK` | FreqMoE | frequency-band trend plus multi-band seasonality | non-learned extractor |
| `INPARFORMER_BLOCK` | InParformer | moving-average trend with periodic-template seasonal head | non-learned extractor |
| `LEDDAM_BLOCK` | LEDDAM | Gaussian-kernel smoothing decomposition operator | non-learned extractor |
| `MOVING_AVERAGE_DECOMPOSITION_BLOCK` | Autoformer/DLinear family | generic moving-average decomposition head | non-learned extractor |
| `NBEATS_INTERPRETABLE` | N-BEATS interpretable stacks | trend and seasonality basis stacks | torch-backed learned prior |
| `PARSIMONY_BLOCK` | parsimony-oriented decomposition | smooth trend with compact harmonic seasonal projection | non-learned extractor |
| `ST_MTM_BLOCK` | ST-MTM | smoothed trend with smoothed periodic seasonal template | non-learned extractor |
| `TIMEKAN_BLOCK` | TimeKAN | template and harmonic seasonal estimates with smoothed trend | non-learned extractor |
| `TIMES2D_BLOCK` | Times2D | multi-period harmonic decomposition head | non-learned extractor |
| `WAVEFORM_BLOCK` | WaveForM | wavelet multiresolution trend-detail decomposition | non-learned extractor |
| `WAVELETMIXER_BLOCK` | WaveletMixer | mixed wavelet detail-level decomposition | non-learned extractor |
| `XPATCH_BLOCK` | xPatch | exponential smoothing trend with local seasonal residual | non-learned extractor |

Their source-paper links are listed in
[docs/method-references.md](docs/method-references.md).

Benchmark-derived methods `DR_TS_REG`, `DR_TS_AE`, and `SL_LIB` do not ship in
the main package. They belong to the companion benchmark repository
[`systems-mechanobiology/de-time-bench`](https://github.com/systems-mechanobiology/de-time-bench).

## Cross-package comparison

DeTime is positioned as a workflow and machine-contract layer beside
specialist packages, not as a replacement for all of them.

## Install

Install the latest released package from PyPI:

```bash
python -m pip install de-time
```

Install optional extras as needed:

```bash
python -m pip install "de-time[multivar]"
python -m pip install "de-time[emd,neural]"
python -m pip install "de-time[notebook]"
```

Install directly from GitHub when you need the unreleased `main` branch:

```bash
python -m pip install "git+https://github.com/systems-mechanobiology/DeTime.git"
```

Do not install the unrelated [`detime`](https://pypi.org/project/detime/)
package from PyPI when you want this project; that package is not DeTime.

## Quickstart

```python
import numpy as np

from detime import DecompositionConfig, decompose

t = np.arange(120, dtype=float)
series = 0.03 * t + np.sin(2.0 * np.pi * t / 12.0)

result = decompose(
    series,
    DecompositionConfig(
        method="SSA",
        params={"window": 24, "rank": 6, "primary_period": 12},
    ),
)

print(result.trend.shape)
print(result.meta["backend_used"])
```

```bash
detime run \
  --method STD \
  --series examples/data/example_series.csv \
  --col value \
  --param period=12 \
  --out_dir out/std_run \
  --output-mode summary
```

## CLI surface

The supported commands are:

- `detime run`
- `detime batch`
- `detime profile`
- `detime version`
- `detime schema`
- `detime recommend`
- `detime benchmark`

The legacy `tsdecomp` executable calls the same code path but emits a
deprecation notice.

## TSDecompose benchmark bridge

The benchmark code remains in the external Hugging Face bundle
[`Zipeng365/TSDecompose-Benchmark`](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Zipeng365/TSDecompose-Benchmark).
DeTime provides a bridge API and CLI that downloads the bundle's
`code/TSDecompose` source snapshot into a local cache and runs its published
paper-core runner.

Fast smoke run:

```bash
detime benchmark --out-dir out/tsdecompose-smoke
```

Full paper-core run:

```bash
detime benchmark --full --out-dir out/tsdecompose-paper-core
```

Python API:

```python
from detime import run_tsdecompose_benchmark

result = run_tsdecompose_benchmark(smoke=True, out_dir="out/tsdecompose-smoke")
print(result.leaderboard_path)
```

## Agent-native surface

DeTime now includes:

- packaged JSON schemas for `config`, `result`, `meta`, and `method-registry`,
- low-token result export modes: `full`, `summary`, and `meta`,
- machine-readable method metadata for registry, docs, and recommendation,
- `detime schema` and `detime recommend`,
- a local-first MCP server at `python -m detime.mcp.server`.

## Package boundary

This repository ships the reusable decomposition software package, docs, tests,
and examples needed for `detime` itself. Benchmark orchestration, leaderboard
artifacts, benchmark scenario galleries, and benchmark-derived methods are
split into the companion repository
[`systems-mechanobiology/de-time-bench`](https://github.com/systems-mechanobiology/de-time-bench).
The `detime benchmark` command is a bridge to the external TSDecompose
benchmark bundle; it does not vendor benchmark-derived methods into the main
package.

Only the top-level `tsdecomp` import and CLI alias remain packaged for
compatibility.

## Quality and evidence

- Release smoke checks live in `scripts/release_smoke_matrix.py`.
- Reviewer-facing documentation consistency checks live in
  `scripts/check_doc_consistency.py`.
- The current performance snapshot is generated by
  `scripts/generate_performance_snapshot.py` and stored under
  `docs/assets/generated/evidence/`.
- Comparison matrices are generated by
  `benchmarks/software_comparison/generate_comparison_evidence.py`.
- Token benchmarks are generated with `tiktoken` by
  `benchmarks/token_benchmarks/generate_token_benchmarks.py`.
- Deterministic agent workflow checks are generated by
  `evals/agent/run_agent_evals.py`.
- The coverage story is intentionally split into core-surface coverage and
  package-wide coverage so the denominator stays explicit.

Release-validation runtime snapshot for selected native-backed paths in the
reviewed environment. These values compare DeTime native-backed paths against
internal Python fallback paths in one environment; they are not a portable
cross-package benchmark.
