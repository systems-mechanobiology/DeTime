# Method References

This page is generated from `MethodRegistry.list_catalog()` so citations,
upstream package links, and method metadata stay aligned.

Current package version target: `0.1.1`.

These links cover the method families and upstream packages used or compared
in the public DeTime workflow surface. `MA_BASELINE` is an in-package smoke
baseline and therefore has no separate upstream citation.
