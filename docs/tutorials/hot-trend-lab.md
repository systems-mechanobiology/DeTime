# Hot Trend Lab: Real Data Trend and Cycle Decomposition

This tutorial column shows how to use De-Time as a real-data decomposition layer for fast-moving research, open-source, market, and public-attention time series.

## Real-data policy

The Hot Trend Lab uses real public data fetched at runtime. It does **not** generate synthetic fallback data. If a source cannot be reached, the notebooks raise an explicit data error and stop.

This matters because the column is meant for overseas readers who may reuse the notebooks as a public-data workflow. A table is publishable only when its source, access date, query, and interpretation limits are visible.

## Why this column belongs in De-Time

A fast-moving public topic usually mixes three signals:

| Component | Interpretation | Example |
|---|---|---|
| `trend` | durable direction | AI paper production is rising across several arXiv categories |
| `season` | repeated cadence | weekly developer activity or monthly submission cycles |
| `residual` | shock outside the smooth pattern | a model release, policy event, ETF-flow break, or media burst |
| `meta` | reproducibility context | source URL, query, period, method, access date |

The point is not to claim prediction. The point is to force every viral topic into the same interpretable result contract before writing the narrative.

## Install optional dependencies

```bash
python -m pip install -e .[dev,docs,notebook]
python -m pip install -r examples/hot_trends/requirements.txt
```

Then open:

```bash
jupyter lab examples/notebooks/hot_trends
```

## Important boundary

This is a research and documentation column. It is not investment advice, not a leaderboard, and not a claim that attention metrics equal adoption or quality.
