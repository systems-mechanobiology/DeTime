# Strategy Map: From Classic Indicators to Decomposition-Aware Signals

The revised tutorial does not only improve Bollinger bands. It rewrites several
classic strategy families by asking what each indicator was trying to estimate.

| Strategy family | Classical version | De-Time rewrite | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| Feature layer | raw close and raw volume | walk-forward price + volume decomposition | implemented in Tutorial 01 |
| Dual moving average | fast SMA > slow SMA on price | fast/slow average on extracted trend, gated by residual and volume | implemented in Tutorial 02 |
| MACD | fast EMA - slow EMA on price | MACD on extracted trend, gated by cycle, residual and volume | implemented in Tutorial 02 |
| Multi-MA alignment | several raw moving averages aligned | trend state + residual stress + participation filter | implemented in Tutorial 02 |
| Trend pullback | buy dip in an uptrend | trend intact + residual cheap + volume confirmation | implemented in Tutorial 02 |
| RSI / Bollinger / price z-score | overbought/oversold on raw price | residual z-score, residual RSI and residual bands with cycle timing | implemented in Tutorial 03 |
| Turtle / Donchian | breakout above prior high | breakout + trend + cycle + residual-overextension + volume confirmation | implemented in Tutorial 04 |
| Pairs trading | spread z-score | decompose spread; trade residual only when spread trend is stable and pair volume/news state is acceptable | implemented in Tutorial 05 |
| Rotation | momentum rank | cross-sectional trend/cycle/residual/volume score with volatility targeting | implemented in Tutorial 06 |

```

```python
from quant_trading.strategy_mean_reversion import (
    make_classic_mean_reversion_weight_grid,

```

```python
