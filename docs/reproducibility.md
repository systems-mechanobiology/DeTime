# Reproducibility

This repository is focused on the `detime` software package itself.

## Included here

- canonical `detime` source code,
- deprecated `tsdecomp` top-level import and CLI alias,
- tests for the retained public surface,
- examples and tutorials for package workflows,
- documentation for installation, APIs, methods, and migration,
- packaged JSON schemas and a minimal MCP server for machine-facing workflows.

## Moved out

Benchmark orchestration, synthetic benchmark generators, leaderboard helpers,
and benchmark-derived methods belong to the companion repository
[`systems-mechanobiology/de-time-bench`](https://github.com/systems-mechanobiology/de-time-bench).

That split keeps the main package installable and reviewable as software rather
than as a mixed library-plus-benchmark artifact.

The release artifacts also exclude transition-era compatibility submodules such
as `tsdecomp.methods.*`, `tsdecomp.leaderboard`, and `tsdecomp.bench_config`.

## External benchmark bridge

De-Time includes a bridge command for the public Hugging Face bundle
[`Zipeng365/TSDecompose-Benchmark`](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Zipeng365/TSDecompose-Benchmark).
The command downloads the bundle's `code/TSDecompose` source snapshot into a
local cache and invokes its published paper benchmark runner.

Smoke run:

```bash
detime benchmark --out-dir out/tsdecompose-smoke
```

Full paper-core run:

```bash
detime benchmark --full --out-dir out/tsdecompose-paper-core
```

Python API:

```python
from detime import run_tsdecompose_benchmark

result = run_tsdecompose_benchmark(smoke=True, out_dir="out/tsdecompose-smoke")
print(result.leaderboard_path)
```

This bridge keeps the benchmark source and benchmark-derived methods outside
the installable De-Time package while still giving readers a direct
reproduction path for the benchmark claims.

## Coverage boundary

The repository now publishes two coverage views so the denominator is explicit:

- **core-surface coverage**
  - the gated `detime` core-plus-flagship contract
- **package-wide coverage**
  - the broader installable `detime` package, including CLI, I/O,
    visualization, wrappers, and machine-facing helpers

The core gate is applied to the canonical `detime` core-plus-flagship surface.

The core-surface denominator intentionally omits:

- the deprecated `tsdecomp` compatibility layer,
- CLI wrappers,
- I/O helpers,
- visualization helpers,
- optional wrappers and non-flagship integrations that remain tested but are
  not part of the gated coverage surface.

The latest local `0.1.1` release-candidate run reached `93.73%`
core-surface coverage and `84.00%` package-wide coverage.

Package-wide coverage is emitted separately in CI and uploaded as a second
artifact so reviewer-facing reports can show both the narrow safety gate and
the broader installable surface.

Optional `.[multivar]` integrations are validated separately in a dedicated
smoke path so `MVMD` / `MEMD` execution evidence is published without
broadening the flagship-method coverage gate.

## Native agreement checks

Native-backed methods are not treated as correctness shortcuts. The test suite
includes numeric agreement checks between native and Python implementations for:

- `SSA`
- `STD`
- `STDR`

The documented tolerances are:

- `SSA`: `atol=1e-6`
- `STD` / `STDR`: `atol=1e-9`

## Evidence Artifacts

- [Performance snapshot JSON](assets/generated/evidence/performance_snapshot.json)
- [Performance summary CSV](assets/generated/evidence/performance_snapshot.csv)
- [Comparison evidence JSON](assets/generated/evidence/comparison_evidence.json)
- [Workflow comparison demo JSON](assets/generated/evidence/workflow_comparison.json)
- [Token benchmark summary JSON](assets/generated/evidence/token_benchmarks.json)
- [Agent eval summary JSON](assets/generated/evidence/agent_eval_summary.json)
- JSON schemas: `src/detime/schema_assets/*.json`

The performance snapshot is reproducible from
`scripts/generate_performance_snapshot.py`. Tutorial outputs are reproducible
from `scripts/generate_tutorial_assets.py`. Schema assets are reproducible from
`scripts/generate_schema_assets.py`. The release smoke report is reproducible
from `scripts/release_smoke_matrix.py`.
