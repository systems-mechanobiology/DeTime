# Citation / Release Notes

## Citation

Use [`CITATION.cff`](https://github.com/systems-mechanobiology/DeTime/blob/main/CITATION.cff) for machine-readable citation metadata.

The current branch targets `0.1.2`. Tagged standalone releases use the
`de-time-v*` convention and publish the `de-time` distribution.

## Release notes
