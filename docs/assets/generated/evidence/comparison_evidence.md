## Family-fairness notes

| family | specialist | specialist_deeper_strength | de_time_position |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| classical decomposition | statsmodels | deeper classical decomposition and statistical modeling | wraps STL and MSTL under one config/result/CLI layer |
| SSA | SSALib | deeper SSA-only environment with SSA-specific tooling | uses SSA as one core method inside a cross-family workflow layer |
| EMD family | PyEMD | deeper EMD-family tooling | exposes EMD and CEEMDAN through the same contract used for other families |
| wavelet workflows | PyWavelets | deeper wavelet transforms and transform-specific APIs | uses wavelets as one workflow option rather than a wavelet-first toolkit |
| unified toolkit layer | PySDKit | broader signal-decomposition toolkit with optional multivariate backends | focuses on time-series decomposition workflows, machine-facing contracts, and compact outputs |
